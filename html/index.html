    <p class="param">Tesla, is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company headquartered in Austin, Texas.
        Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles (electric cars and trucks), battery energy storage from home to
        grid-scale,
        solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable
        companies and is, as of 2023,
        the world's most valuable automaker. In 2021, the company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric
        vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles,
        capturing 21% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market and 14% of the plug-in market (which includes
        plug-in hybrids).
        Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in
        the United States.
        Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 6.5
        gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2022.</p>
    <h2 class="minititle">TESLA HISTORY</h2>
    <p class="param">The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.
        Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively. Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car
        manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer
        software, and the proprietary motor".

        Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. In February 2004, the company raised $7.5
        million in series A funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale
        of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest
        shareholder of Tesla. J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.

        A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five Eberhard, Tarpenning,
        Wright, Musk, and Straubel to call themselves co-founders</p>
